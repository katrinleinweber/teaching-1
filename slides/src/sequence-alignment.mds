# In phylogenetics, *homology* means..

# Structural alignment is another perspective

# Sequence alignment is hard!

# Multiple sequence alignment: summary
* Use PRANK, perhaps through [Wasabi](http://wasabiapp.org/)
* If you need a faster algorithm and are happy with a less good result, try [Muscle](http://drive5.com/muscle/)
* If you really care about alignments (and trees) use BAli-Phy.
